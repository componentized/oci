# Bump the version of the wit interface package, and of the crates.
#
#   build/scripts/bump-version.sh <new-version>
#
# Updates the package declaration and every reference to the package in tracked files, then
# refreshes the generated wit dependencies. The crates share the interface's version: the
# workspace version the crates inherit, and the workspace's requirements on its own crates that name
# a version, e.g. `componentized-constants = { path = "./crates/componentized-constants", version =
# "=0.2.1-dev" }`, move to the new version too. A repository without a workspace version only bumps the
# interface. The default version of the bump-version workflow moves to the new version, the next bump
# is offered from it. Items whose `@since` names an unreleased (prerelease)
# version move to the new version, since they were never published under the old one. Items
# released under the old version keep their `@since`.
#
#   0.1.0-dev -> 0.1.0      releases 0.1.0, `@since(version = 0.1.0-dev)` becomes 0.1.0
#   0.1.0     -> 0.2.0-dev  starts 0.2.0, `@since(version = 0.1.0)` is unchanged
#
# PACKAGE  the interface package, the first package declared in wit/worlds.wit by default, e.g.
#          componentized:valkey
