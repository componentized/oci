#
# `wasm-tools component wit` prints the items of a component's WIT in the order the component
# defines them, which differs between builds of the same sources, e.g. a build optimized by
# wasm-opt. Each line is printed with the items it's nested in, e.g.
#
#   package wasi:http@0.3.0 > interface types > resource request > get-method: func() -> method;
#
# the names a `use` imports are sorted, and the lines are sorted.
