# Prints the commit, a child of <base>, the commit the changes are staged against. No branch is moved
# to it. The changes are only staged locally to find the changed files and their modes.
#
# The commit is authored, committed and signed off (DCO) by the app's bot. GitHub only signs commits
# it attributes entirely to the app, so the author and committer are left for GitHub to fill in. The
# user who triggered the workflow is credited as a co-author, with their GitHub noreply email so their
# email address isn't exposed. A run started by the app has no one else to credit.
#
# GH_TOKEN           a token for the app, with contents write permission, and workflows write
#                    permission to change workflow files
# APP_SLUG           the slug of the app, e.g. custodian
# GITHUB_REPOSITORY  the repository to create the commit in, e.g. componentized/http
# GITHUB_ACTOR       the user who triggered the workflow, credited as a co-author
# GITHUB_ACTOR_ID    the id of the user
# RUNNER_TEMP        a directory for temporary files
